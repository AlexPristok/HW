                            Why did dinosaurs go extinct?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Dinosaurs dominated the planet for about 130 million years, which is 100 times more than a person exists. But 65 million years ago, they became extinct along with most of the marine life and flying reptiles. But why did this happen? There are several versions. The most common version is that our planet collided with an asteroid. This caused a terrible explosion that led to tragic changes not only in the Earth's climate, but also in its geological structure. Other scientists argue that the end of the era of dinosaurs was put by the first predatory mammals that feed on their eggs and cubs. There is also a version that the giants disappeared through a decrease in the water level in the sea or a jump in the magnetic field of the planet. But, what really happened, it is no longer possible to find out.
